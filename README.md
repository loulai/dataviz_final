# Summary
These charts are taken from the Crunchbase database, through my Crunchbase Pro account. Crunchbase provides information about startup companies and funding. These charts are able to summarize the state of funding and confirm some assumptions, such as the amount of total funding ever is related to the amount of future funding a company can raise, and that San Francisco is by far the largest attractor for funding. Some things that surprised me were how certain months (January 2019 and April 2019) had a significant peak of total amount of funding. However, upon further investigation, we discover that this can be explained by the presence of two significant companies.
